<h2><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE"></a>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p>This <i>jeu d’esprit</i> was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was
it written, purely for my own amusement, and with no thought of
publication. I sent daily instalments of it to a friend in New York, the
late <span class="smcap">Chas F. Briggs</span>. He urged me to let it be printed and I at last
consented to its anonymous publication. The secret was kept till after
several persons had laid claim to its authorship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/image-vii.png" width="450" height="111" alt="[Image unavailable.]" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> being the commonest mode of procedure, I premise a few candid remarks</p>

<p class="nind">
TO THE READER:<br />
</p>

<p>This trifle, begun to please only myself and my own private fancy, was
laid on the shelf. But some friends, who had seen it, induced me, by
dint of saying they liked it, to put it in print. That is, having come
to that very conclusion, I asked their advice when ’t would make no
confusion. For though (in the gentlest of ways) they had hinted it was
scarce worth the while, I should doubtless have printed it.</p>

<p>I began it, intending a Fable, a frail, slender thing, rhyme-ywinged,
with a sting in its tail. But, by addings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> alterings not previously
planned, digressions chance-hatched, like birds’ eggs in the sand, and
dawdlings to suit every whimsey’s demand (always freeing the bird which
I held in my hand, for the two perched, perhaps out of reach, in the
tree),&mdash;it grew by degrees to the size which you see. I was like the old
woman that carried the calf, and my neighbors, like hers, no doubt,
wonder and laugh; and when, my strained arms with their grown burthen
full, I call it my Fable, they call it a bull.</p>

<p>Having scrawled at full gallop (as far as that goes) in a style that is
neither good verse nor bad prose, and being a person whom nobody knows,
some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than it is
becoming to be, but I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in
following wherever I wander at pleasure, that, in short, I take more
than a young author’s lawful ease and laugh in a queer way so like
Mephistopheles, that the Public will doubt, as they grope<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> through my
rhythm, if in truth I am making fun <i>of</i> them or <i>with</i> them.</p>

<p>So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is
already secured. For there is not a poet throughout the whole land but
will purchase a copy or two out of hand, in the fond expectation of
being amused in it, by seeing his betters cut up and abused in it. Now,
I find, by a pretty exact calculation, there are something like ten
thousand bards in the nation, of that special variety whom the Review
and Magazine critics call <i>lofty</i> and <i>true</i>, and about thirty thousand
(<i>this</i> tribe is increasing) of the kinds who are termed <i>full of
promise and pleasing</i>. The Public will see by a glance at this schedule,
that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting <i>them</i>,
since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot.</p>

<p>As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my
pages, with praises or blames, let them <small>SEND IN THEIR CARDS</small>, without
further <small>DELAY</small>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> my friend <span class="smcap">G. P. Putnam</span>, Esquire, in Broadway, where a
list will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour of
receiving the card. Then, taking them up as I chance to have time (that
is if their names can be twisted in rhyme), I will honestly give each
his <small>PROPER POSITION</small>, at the rate of <small>ONE AUTHOR</small> to each <small>NEW EDITION</small>. Thus
a PREMIUM is offered sufficiently <small>HIGH</small> (as the magazines say when they
tell their best lie) to induce bards to <small>CLUB</small> their resources and buy the
balance of every edition, until they have all of them fairly been run
through the mill.</p>

<p>One word to such readers (judicious and wise) as read books with
something behind the mere eyes, of whom in the country, perhaps, there
are two, including myself, gentle reader, and you. All the characters
sketched in this slight <i>jeu d’esprit</i>, though it may be they seem, here
and there, rather free and drawn from a somewhat too cynical standpoint,
are <i>meant</i> to be faithful, for that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> grand point, and none but
an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you, without any
subterfuge, that he sits in Diogenes’ tub.</p>

<h2><a name="A_PRELIMINARY_NOTE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION" id="A_PRELIMINARY_NOTE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION"></a>A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> it well may be reckoned, of all composition, the species at once
most delightful and healthy, is a thing which an author, unless he be
wealthy and willing to pay for that kind of delight, is not, in all
instances, called on to write, though there are, it is said, who, their
spirits to cheer, slip in a new title-page three times a year, and in
this way snuff up an imaginary savor of that sweetest of dishes, the
popular favor,&mdash;much as if a starved painter should fall to and treat
Ugolino inside to a picture of meat.</p>

<p>You remember (if not, pray turn backward and look) that, in writing the
preface which ushered my book, I treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> you, excellent Public, not
merely with a cool disregard, but downright cavalierly. Now I would not
take back the least thing I then said, though I thereby could butter
both sides of my bread, for I never could see that an author owed aught
to the people he solaced, diverted, or taught; and, as for mere fame, I
have long ago learned that the persons by whom it is finally earned are
those with whom <i>your</i> verdict weighed not a pin, unsustained by the
higher court sitting within.</p>

<p>But I wander from what I intended to say,&mdash;that you have, namely, shown
such a liberal way of thinking and so much æsthetic perception of
anonymous worth in the handsome reception you gave to my book, spite of
some private piques (having bought the first thousand in barely two
weeks), that I think, past a doubt, if you measured the phiz of yours
most devotedly, Wonderful Quiz, you would find that its vertical section
was shorter, by an inch and two tenths, or ’twixt that and a quarter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span></p>

<p>You have watched a child playing&mdash;in those wondrous years when belief is
not bound to the eyes and the ears, and the vision divine is so clear
and unmarred, that each baker of pies in the dirt is a bard? Give a
knife and a shingle, he fits out a fleet, and, on that little mud-puddle
over the street his fancy, in purest good faith, will make sail round
the globe with a puff of his breath for a gale, will visit, in barely
ten minutes, all climes, and do the Columbus-feat hundreds of times. Or,
suppose the young poet fresh stored with delights from that Bible of
childhood “The Arabian Nights,” he will turn to a crony and cry, “Jack,
let’s play that I am a Genius!” Jacky straightway makes Aladdin’s Lamp
out of a stone, and, for hours, they enjoy each his own supernatural
powers. This is all very pretty and pleasant, but then suppose our two
urchins have grown into men, and both have turned authors,&mdash;one says to
his brother, “Let’s play we’re the American somethings or other,&mdash;say<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>
Homer or Sophocles, Goethe or Scott (only let them be big enough no
matter what). Come, you shall be Byron or Pope, which you choose: I’ll
be Coleridge, and both shall write mutual reviews.” So they both (as
mere strangers) before many days send each other a cord of anonymous
bays. Each, piling his epithets, smiles in his sleeve to see what his
friend can be made to believe; each, reading the other’s unbiased
review, thinks&mdash;Here’s pretty high praise, but no more than my due.
Well, we laugh at them both, and yet make no great fuss when the same
farce is acted to benefit us. Even I, who, if asked, scarce a month
since, what Fudge meant, should have answered, the dear Public’s
critical judgment, begin to think sharp-witted Horace spoke sooth when
he said that the Public <i>sometimes</i> hit the truth.</p>

<p>In reading these lines, you perhaps have a vision of a person in pretty
good health and condition; and yet, since I put forth my primary
edition, I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span> crushed, scorched, withered, used up and put down
(by Smith with the cordial assistance of Brown), in all, if you put any
faith in my rhymes, to the number of ninety-five several times, and,
while I am writing,&mdash;I tremble to think of it, for I may at this moment
be just on the brink of it,&mdash;Molybdostom, angry at being omitted, has
begun a critique,&mdash;am I not to be pitied?<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Now I shall not crush <i>them</i>, since, indeed, for that matter, no
pressure I know of could render them flatter; nor wither nor scorn
them,&mdash;no action of fire could make either them or their articles drier;
nor waste time in putting them down&mdash;I am thinking not their own
self-inflation will keep them from sinking; for there’s this
contradiction about the whole bevy,&mdash;though without the least weight,
they are awfully heavy. No, my dear honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span> bore, <i>surdo fabulam
narras</i>, they are no more to me than a rat in the arras. I can walk with
the Doctor, get facts from the Don, or draw out the Lambish quintessence
of John, and feel nothing more than a half-comic sorrow, to think that
they all will be lying to-morrow tossed carelessly up on the waste-paper
shelves and forgotten by all but their half-dozen selves. Once snug in
my attic, my fire in a roar, I leave the whole pack of them outside the
door. With Hakluyt or Purchas I wander away to the black northern seas
or barbaric Cathay; get <i>fou</i> with O’Shanter, and sober me then with
that builder of brick-kilnish dramas, rare Ben; snuff Herbert, as holy
as a flower on a grave; with Fletcher wax tender, o’er Chapman grow
brave; with Marlowe or Kyd take a fine poet-rave; in Very, most Hebrew
of Saxons, find peace; with Lycidas welter on vext Irish seas; with
Webster grow wild, and climb earthward again, down by mystical Browne’s
Jacob’s-ladder-like brain, to that spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span> Pepys (Cotton’s version)
Montaigne; find a new depth in Wordsworth, undreamed of before,&mdash;that
marvel, a poet divine who can bore. Or, out of my study the scholar
thrown off, Nature holds up her shield ’gainst the sneer and the scoff;
the landscape, forever consoling and kind pours her wine and her oil on
the smarts of the mind. The waterfall, scattering its vanishing gems;
the tall grove of hemlocks, with moss on their stems, like plashes of
sunlight; the pond in the woods, where no foot but mine and the
bittern’s intrudes, where pitcher-plants purple and gentians hard by
recall to September the blue of June’s sky; these are all my kind
neighbors, and leave me no wish to say aught to you all, my poor
critics, but&mdash;pish! I’ve buried the hatchet; I’m twisting an allumette
out of one of you now, and relighting my calumet. In your private
capacities, come when you please, I will give you my hand and a fresh
pipe apiece.</p>

<p>As I ran through the leaves of my poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span> little book to take a fond
author’s first tremulous look, it was quite an excitement to hunt the
<i>errata</i>, sprawled in as birds’ tracks are in some kinds of strata (only
these made things crookeder). Fancy an heir that a father had seen born
well-featured and fair, turning suddenly wry-nosed, club-footed,
squint-eyed, hair-lipped, wapper-jawed, carrot-haired, from a pride
become an aversion,&mdash;my case was yet worse. A club-foot (by way of a
change) in a verse, I might have forgiven, an <i>o’s</i> being wry, a limp in
an <i>e</i>, or a cock in an <i>i</i>,&mdash;but to have the sweet babe served in <i>pi</i>!
I am not queasy-stomached, but such a Thyestean banquet as that was
quite out of the question.</p>

<p>In the edition now issued, no pains are neglected, and my verses, as
orators say, stand corrected. Yet some blunders remain of the Public’s
own make, which I wish to correct for my personal sake. For instance, a
character drawn in pure fun and condensing the traits of a dozen in one,
has been, as I hear, by some persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span> applied to a good friend of mine,
whom to stab in the side, as we walked along chatting and joking
together, would not be <i>my</i> way. I can hardly tell whether a question
will ever arise in which he and I should by any strange fortune agree
but meanwhile, my esteem for him grows as I know him, and, though not
the best judge on earth of a poem, he knows what it is he is saying and
why, and is honest and fearless, two good points which I have not found
so rife I can easily smother my love for them, whether on my side or t’
other.</p>

<p>From my other <i>anonymi</i>, you may be sure that I know what is meant by a
caricature, and what by a portrait. There <i>are</i> those who think it is
capital fun to be spattering their ink on quiet, unquarrelsome folk, but
the minute the game changes sides and the others begin it, they see
something savage and horrible in it. As for me I respect neither women
nor men for their gender, nor own any sex in a pen. I choose just to
hint to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> some causeless unfriends that, as far as I know, there are
always two ends (and one of them heaviest, too) to a staff, and two
parties also to every good laugh.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
